The csv files can be used with any other projects including mobile app development with the below conditions 
taken from  quran for android

Terms of use
you are free to use parts or all of Quran csv in your application with some conditions:

	•	your app must be respectful of the book of Allah. adding advertisements above and below each page 
	  of Quran is unacceptable, for example (yes, someone actually did that).
	•	your app cannot make money from ads or from sales. there are many reasons for this:
	◦	we made these data files for the benefit of people and not to make a profit
	◦	the data costs us money (for serving the pages, translations, etc), not to mention the time to develop it and 
	  to support it.
	•	if you use this data files with an application using any of the Quran data (the images, 
	  the	translations, etc), you must provide a link to the respective data source page (tanzil.net for 
	  the translations and the quran images project for the images) as well as 
	  http://qurandownload.org within your application (in an about page) and in your application 		description in       the market or app store.
	•	if you use part of (or all of) the qurancsv code or graphics, you must provide a link back to the 
	  http://qurandownload.org in your application description and your application itself in 		an about section.

Please if you made any modifications please contribute back to the project.
